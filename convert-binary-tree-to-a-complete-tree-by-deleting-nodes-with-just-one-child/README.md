<div><p>Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.</p>
<p>This problem was asked by Yahoo.</p>
<p>Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.</p>
<p>For example, given the following tree:</p>
<pre><code>         0
      /     \
    1         2
  /            \
3                 4
  \             /   \
    5          6     7
</code></pre><p>You should convert it to:</p>
<pre><code>     0
  /     \
5         4
        /   \
       6     7
</code></pre>
